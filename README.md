# ringIntensityDistribution
This macro divides the cell into rings of identical area that converge towards the nucleus center. The intensity density of the interest signal is then measured per ring and normalized to the total intensity density of the cell. In this manner, the intensity distribution of a target protein can be compared between cells of different shapes and sizes.
